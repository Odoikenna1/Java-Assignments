collect and read input from user

store input in variable factorial user input

initialize a variable for factorial result assign 1 to it



use a loop to iteratate a block of code

	initialize a counter variable for counter assign 1 to it

	set a condition; counter is less than factorial for user input

	increase count by 1

set your arithmetic operation for exponential calculation

then print the update value as the factorial of the user input
